#### xenforoaddon_chatBannedCriteria4sChat

### Abandon Date

2017-01-16

### Scenario

On a discussion board with [Chat by Siropu](https://xenforo.com/community/resources/chat-by-siropu.4309/) installed, users kicked or banned from chat had no consequences on the rest of the site, where the chat moderator had to contact an administrator to apply the restrictions mentioned in the rules and remove them after the time has passed.

### Solution

An add-on that exposes the chat bans as criteria into the promotions framework.
